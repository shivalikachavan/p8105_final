#### Motivation

Following the [2018 Supreme Court decision](https://www.klgates.com/Supreme-Court-Strikes-Down-Ban-on-Sports-Wagering-05-18-2018 ) to rescind the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA), 39 states have legalized sports gambling, and we would like to look at the public health effects of this decision. More recently, there was a lot of media buzz over the [NBA gambling scandal](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/23/nyregion/nba-gambling-scandal-explained.html) and an ongoing debate over [NCAA rules]( https://www.espn.com/college-sports/story/_/id/46762598/ncaa-delays-rule-change-permitting-college-athletes-bet-professional-sports) regarding athlete gambling, involving the increasingly popular player-specific proposition “prop” bets. 

The specific questions we aim to answer are:

1.  Did the total (inflation-adjusted) handle (total amount of money wagered) for sportsbooks increase significantly across states after 2018?

2.  Does legalized sports gambling have a negative effect on public health outcomes? This involves analyzing changes in rates of depression (or other mental disorders), domestic violence, and substance abuse in states where sports betting is legal.

3.  Using the 2018 as the inflection point, are these health outcomes stratified by demographics (age, sex, race, tax bracket, and education level) and state?
