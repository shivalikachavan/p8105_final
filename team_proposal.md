#### Motivation

Following the [2018 Supreme Court
decision](https://www.klgates.com/Supreme-Court-Strikes-Down-Ban-on-Sports-Wagering-05-18-2018)
to rescind the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA),
39 states have legalized sports gambling, and we would like to look at
the public health effects of this decision. More recently, there was a
lot of media buzz over the [NBA gambling
scandal](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/23/nyregion/nba-gambling-scandal-explained.html)
and an ongoing debate over [NCAA
rules](https://www.espn.com/college-sports/story/_/id/46762598/ncaa-delays-rule-change-permitting-college-athletes-bet-professional-sports)
regarding athlete gambling, involving the increasingly popular
player-specific proposition “prop” bets.

The specific questions we aim to answer are:

1.  Did the total (inflation-adjusted) handle (total amount of money
    wagered) for sportsbooks increase significantly across states after
    2018?

2.  Does legalized sports gambling have a negative effect on public
    health outcomes? This involves analyzing changes in rates of
    depression (or other mental disorders), domestic violence, and
    substance abuse in states where sports betting is legal.

3.  Using the 2018 as the inflection point, are these health outcomes
    stratified by demographics (age, sex, race, tax bracket, and
    education level) and state?
